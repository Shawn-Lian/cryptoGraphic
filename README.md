- Unlike tradition stocks, cryptocurrencies are not backed by any assets or cash flow, the only thing driving their prices is sentiment-driven speculation. As sentiment changes, prices can  change dramatically.

- Therefore, compared with traditional financial derivatives, the data of the factors affecting the price changes of cryptocurrencies is more transparent, meaning that we do not need to get some  difficult-to-obtain data such as company financial reports, thus making the exploratory data analysis more accessible.

# 2 Data Resources

- Most of the cryptocurrency data will be obtained by the API of [CoinAPI](https://www.coinapi.io/).

- The traditional stocks data will be obtained by Yahoo Finance API [YH Finance API](https://www.yahoofinanceapi.com)

- We will also need some supportive data for exploratory data analysis, an primary data source will be [Google Trend](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US)

# 3 Potential Research Questions

- Explore the development trend of cryptocurrencies from the market size and their public attention. We can obtain the data of cryptocurrencies by coin-API and the public attention will be quantified by using the Google trend index.

- Show how the cryptocurrencies are different from traditional financial derivatives by comparing their behavior when affected by the positive or negative factor under the same time period. YH Finance API mentioned above can provide us with the data in the traditional financial market. 

- What factors are related to the price of cryptocurrencies? Rather than modeling, we will apply an exploratory data analysis on this question. To solving this question, we will get further information by searching through more data resources to determine how to measure some messy  non-numerical factor.
